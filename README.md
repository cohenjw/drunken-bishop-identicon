# About
A program that utilises the Drunken Bishop algorithm to produce a unique ASCII-art indentification icon (identicon), based on a hash.

# Future
Maybe play around with making the output not ASCII, but something a bit more interesting, perhaps utilising graphics (via https://golang.org/pkg/image/ for example).
